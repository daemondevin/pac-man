# PortableApps Compiler & Management
----------

Welcome! This project started out as a modified variant of the official [PortableApps.com Launcher](https://portableapps.com/portableapps.comlauncher). The creator of the original version left the project over 5 years ago and since then, all development and updates ceased completely and _PAL_ became stagnant. PortableApps Compiler & Management (or _Pac-Man_ for short), is an alternative solution to creating portable applications that still adhere to the [PortableApps.com Format](https://portableapps.com/manuals/PortableApps.comLauncher/ref/paf/index.html#portableapps-com-format-specification) specification. 

From the uninitiated software programmer wanting a reliable method for porting their programs portability, to the most loyal and dedicated _PAF Developer_ who would love to finally see full-featured and reliable utility for developing _PAFs_â€”**Pac-Man** is a much better solution when it comes to creating a portable launcher for the more complex Windows applications. Even if a program seems to thread itself deep within the Windows registry and/or file-system, this utility will most likely have you covered.
 
While the techniques being implemented by this project are highly advanced, this can be used by beginners who are just starting out with portable programming, getting familiar with the practices of the official [PortableApps.com Launcher](https://portableapps.com/portableapps.comlauncher) will greatly improve your ability to understand the features being implemented in the project. Understanding the intricacies behind the advanced capabilities currently being used by this project.

With this branch you will find the coding practices of Chris Morgan, FukenGruven, Azure Zanculmarktum, and myself (daemon.devin). You will also see minor influence from contributors like LegendaryHawk, DoomStorm, and other fellow developers as well. So you can expect to see great things to come out of this experimental build.

## Under Construction  
---------- 

The following is a list of things currently being worked on for Pac-Man so you can look forward too in this project. This list is a work in progress so come back later to see if these features have been added.

- [ ] __AiO GUI__

Working on a nice all-in-one GUI that will enable the developer to quickly create the necessary configuration files for creating and generating a PA.c compliant portable application. After creation, than ask to compile.

- [ ] __AiO Compiler__

Working on combining both the PortableApps.com Launcher with the PortableApps.com Installer. Basically, have a single GUI (including the config creator) which can be used to create and generate a portable application package from compiling the portable launcher to creating the PAF installer.

- [ ] __Etc. Etc. And So On__

Other things could follow depending on our availability, interest.. and of course the interest and support from others.

## Branches
----------

There are two branches in which you may find in this project. The **Master Branch** (_a.k.a._ Stable Edition) and the [**Dev Branch**](https://github.com/daemondevin/pac-man/tree/dev) (_a.k.a._ Development Edition). In the case for the stable variant (which you're currently browsing), you can rest assured you're building launchers with a (_near_)bug-free utility, but the latter case is meant for the cutting-edge of development. Don't expect the Dev. Branch to work-out-of-the-box as it is constantly under going revisions for testing new ideas and theoratical code. There **will** be bugs hidden throughout the experimental version.


## Features
----------

The following is a list of features that is currently available with PortableApps Compiler. Everything listed here has been tested and is in working order.

- Everything that is available with [PortableApps.com Launcher](https://portableapps.com/apps/development/portableapps.com_launcher) is also available with PortableApps Compiler.
- Minipulating Windows Services.
- Dealing with Windows Tasks.
- Registering DLL files.
- Registry redirection support.
- File-system redirection support.
- Automatic [code-signing](#code-signing) with the [CompilerSigner](#compilersignerexe)
- Font support for apps that make use of fonts.
- **Hidden Functionality**  
  - To skip the welcome page and bypass that first message, you can simply add `SkipWelcomePage=true` to the section under `[LauncherCompiler]` in the `settings.ini` file inside the `Data` folder. 
  - More hidden extras soon to come!

----------

#### __Launcher.ini__

__Environment Variables__

- `%PROGRAMDATA%` has now been added and kept `%ALLUSERSAPPDATA%` for backwards compatibility. Both can be used anywhere you can use an evironment variable.
- `%PAL:CommonFiles%` may now be used within the _Launcher.ini_ configuration file. This environment variable will point to `..\PortableApps\CommonFiles` if applicable. Can be used anywhere you can use an environment variable.
> Example:
> ```INI
> [Environment]
> PATH=%PATH%;%PAL:CommonFiles%\AndroidSDK
> JAVA_HOME=%PAL:CommonFiles%\Java64
> ```

Added new keys to the `[Activate]` section. They are as follows (a short description of what each key means or does can be found further below):
> Note: You should only use the following keys if you need them, otherwise they should be omitted entirely.
```INI

## Code-Signing
----------
I have created a small, commandline utility (`CompilerSigner.exe`, source included) to help with code signing using dual signature hashing algorithm standards (_SHA-2_ and _SHA-1_). If you set `[Team]CertSigning` to equal true along with the other need information, than no further assistance is required on your part as this tool will handle the signing for you but [refer further below](#compilersigner.exe) for how to use this tool on the command line for other things you may wish to sign. I decided to use both because Windows 8 supports SHA256 certificates (SHA-2 hashing algorithm); whereas, Windows 7 may only support SHA1 certificates (SHA-1 hashing algorithm). It should be noted that Windows 10 has stopped accepting SHA-1 certificates and certificate chains for Authenticode-signed binaries (unless a timestamp marked the binary as being signed before 1/1/2016). You can visit this [Microsoft Security Advisory article][MSAdvisory] on the availability of SHA-2 code signing support for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 for more information about this topic. If you've got a certificate you wish to sign your launchers with than read the following for information on how to get started. 

* __CertSigning:__ If set to true, the `Launcher.exe` will automatically be signed
>__*ATTENTION:*__ As it is written right now, the `PortableApps.comLauncherGenerator.exe` expects the certificate file to be the developer's name (same as the `[Team]Developer` key's value) and located in `..\Other\Source\Contrib\certificates`. 
> 
> _NOTE_: If your certificate requires you to use a password, refer to lines 741 and 742 and input your password on column 62.
> Be sure it is similar to something like this: `/p "PASSWORD"` where PASSWORD is your password.
* __CertExtension:__ If the key `CertSigning` is set to true then this should be set to the certificate's file extension without the period (e.g. "_pfx_" not "_.pfx_").
* __CertTimestamp:__ Here you can choose which time-stamping service you would like to use. Refer to the table below for a small list of available services and their available hashing algorithms. I would recommend using a service which uses both signature hashes. Be aware that this key is case-sensitive. If this key is omitted, the compiler will default to using _Comodo_.

|       __CertTimestamp__=*`Value`*     	|     __Timestamp Service__    	| __Algorithms__ 	|
|:------------------------	|:----------------------------	|:--------------------	|
| `Comodo`     	| Comodo Group, Inc.           	| _SHA-1_ & _SHA-2_    	|
| `Verisign`   	| Verisign, Inc.               	| _SHA-1_ & _SHA-2_    	|
| `GlobalSign` 	| GMO GlobalSign, Inc.         	| _SHA-1_ & _SHA-2_    	|
| `DigiCert`   	| DigiCert, Inc.               	| _SHA-1_ & _SHA-2_    	|
| `Starfield`  	| Starfield Technologies, LLC. 	| _SHA-1_ & _SHA-2_    	|
| `Entrust`  	| Entrust DataCard Corp.	 	| _SHA-1_ & _SHA-2_    	|
| `SwissSign`  	| SwissSign AG                 	| _SHA-2_              	|


### CompilerSigner.exe
If you'd like to use `CompilerSigner.exe` outside the compiling wizard, you can use the following commandline parameters to do so. When you call this tool, be sure to call it from where it's currently located within the `Other\Source` directory because this tool assumes that the `signtool.exe` utility is in `Contrib\bin\signtool`. I'll update it to use a static file from inside the binary but until than, keep the stucture as is otherwise it will not work correctly.

```
CompilerSigner.exe --switch=value

	 --PFX= | Path to the certificate.
	--PASS= | If your certificate requires a password.
	 --TSA= | This can be any of the above Time-Stamping Authorities listed in the table above.
	--HASH= | Either SHA1 or SHA2 - NOTE: when using dual signing, be sure to sign using SHA1 first.
	 --EXE= | Path to the binary you wish to sign.
	--MODE= | When set to offline, this optional parameter will tell it to not add support for time-stamping.

For example:
	CompilerSigner.exe --PFX=MyCert.p12 --PASS=PASSWORD --TSA=Entrust --HASH=SHA2 --EXE=MyProgram.exe --MODE=
```

## Documentation
----------

I've begin a small website dedicated to documenting anything I've deemed invaluable in my findings while I've devoted my time to PAFing. You should know that the content you find there is (or will be over time) a collection of help files and guides mostly focused on the making of PAFs. In some circles it's considered the most complete guide to making PAFs with PAL. So I encourage any novice PAFers to give it a visit; you can read up on a wide range of related topics from Registry best-practices to making your own self-signed certificates to sign your PAFs with. 

I've started this because the documentation which is supplied with PAL by PortableApps.com doesn't have, in my humble opinion, any solid information on the power and complexities it's framework has. So I've taken it upon myself to start working on jotting down this unofficial, but my official, guide to making a PAF with PAL. As time has gone by the website has taken on new meaning which now helps developers to better understand the inner workings of the PAL I'm working on here. Not only that but it also goes into great detail in explaining how certain applications and their components are used on a system; which will help you better understand what you're using in this project and why.

Because I am only just one man who has to live outside of my computer, the documentation project (like this project) will take sometime to finish (if ever) so please forgive me on it's incompleteness. This will also serve as a reference/cheat-sheet for those (I know I'll need it, which is partly why I've started it) who need a quick reminder on certain functions and macros for use within the `custom.nsh` file. As an added bonus, all (not yet but most) of the source code I've used here is outlined and better explained/documented there as well. For instance, visit this [page][DocsRegDLL] for a short guide on registering DLLs and all the macros I used to create the `RegisterDLL.nsh` segment. You can visit this [page][DocsServices] for an exhaustive tutorial on dealing with Windows Services; plus it explains what each macro is and does within the `Services.nsh` segment and how to use them in action.
